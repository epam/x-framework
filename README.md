XFramework
===========

# Getting started

## What is XFramework?

Version 0.9.1

XFramework (next XF) is a small yet powerful Javascript framework for quick development of cross-device web applications. Honestly saying, XF is a high-level framework based on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) that implements its own architecture paradigm, based on MV* on the component level.

XFramework makes it easy to reuse the application logic and provide various layouts or widgets for different devices based on the criteria that you define.

XFramework is designed to be extremely modular, flexible, fast, and easy to use. To develop an app in X-Framework a developer should be familiar with common web technologies such as HTML/CSS/JS, LESS for editing styles, Handlebars-style templating and have an understanding of how MV* architecture works. Experience using Backbone.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, jQuery Mobile or other framework will be helpful.

*TODO: update!*
XFramework currently features:

* A solid app architecture
* Separation of templates for different devices and/or screens
* Commonly needed reusable UI elements like headers, footers, tabs, lists, dialogs
* Touch-friendly form elements
* A set of vector icons

The roadmap for the next versions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/epam/x-framework/issues).

## Installing XFramework Generator

You don't need to download the source code from the repo, create  all the necessary files for the web app, writing two thousands line of code just to create a `Hello world!` app. XFramework Generator can make everything for you.

XF Generator has a number of dependencies such as:
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [NPM](https://npmjs.org)
* [Yeoman] (http://yeoman.io)

To install first two of them on Mac OS X or Windows computers you just need to download a package from [nodejs.org/download/](http://nodejs.org/download/). For other platforms see the [readme](https://npmjs.org/doc/README.html).

After installing node.js and npm go to terminal and install Yeoman writing `npm install -g yo` (with `sudo` if necessary).

Almost there! After these steps you need to install XF Generator with `npm install -g generator-xf`.
